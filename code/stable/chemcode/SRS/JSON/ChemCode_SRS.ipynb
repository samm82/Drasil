    "# Introduction\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:Intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemical equations are common ways of representing chemical reactions ([Fig:physSysFig](#Figure:physSysFig) shows an example of a chemical equation). Subscripts indicate the number of atoms of each element present in the given chemical compound. A chemical equation is \"balanced\" if there are the same number of atoms of each element before and after the reaction takes place, which satisfies the Law of Conservation of Mass. Chemical equations are balanced by introducing coefficients before each chemical formula (this coefficient may be \"1\", in which case is implicit and not added to the equation). We want a tool to balance chemical equations automatically to improve the productivity of scientists and engineers and reduce the potential for human error. This program should balance a given chemical equation if it is feasible and if it is not, it should provide a message communicating this to the user. The program that performs these tasks as documented here will be called Chemistry Code (ChemCode).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for ChemCode. This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the requirements, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of Document\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:DocPurpose\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of this document is to record the requirements of the Chemistry Code. Goals, assumptions, theoretical models, definitions, and other model derivation information are specified, allowing the reader to fully understand and verify the purpose and scientific basis of ChemCode. With the exception of [system constraints](#Sec:SysConstraints), this SRS will remain abstract, describing what problem is being solved, but not how to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document will be used as a starting point for subsequent development phases, including writing the design specification and the software verification and validation plan. The design document will show how the requirements are to be realized, including decisions on the numerical algorithms and programming environment. The verification and validation plan will show the steps that will be used to increase confidence in the software documentation and the implementation. Although the SRS fits in a series of documents that follow the so-called waterfall model, the actual development process is not constrained in any way. Even when the waterfall model is not followed, as Parnas and Clements point out <a href=#parnasClements1986>parnasClements1986</a> , the most logical way to present the documentation is still to \"fake\" a rational design process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope of Requirements\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:ReqsScope\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the requirements includes all inputted chemical equations where the total number of chemical compounds is at most one more than the total number of elements. These chemical equations will be balanced with integer coefficients. The scope also includes all inputted chemical formulas that describe real chemical compounds, are formatted following a set of conventions, and only consist of atomic symbols and subscripts (including the fractional subscripts in nonstoichiometric compounds).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics of Intended Reader\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:ReaderChars\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviewers of this documentation should have an understanding of high school chemistry (namely stochiometry) and third year linear optimization (namely integer programming). The users of ChemCode can have a lower level of expertise, as explained in [Sec:User Characteristics](#Sec:UserChars).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Organization of Document\n",
    "<a id=\"Sec:DocOrg\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The organization of this document follows the template for an SRS for scientific computing software proposed by <a href=#koothoor2013>koothoor2013</a>  and <a href=#smithLai2005>smithLai2005</a> . The presentation follows the standard pattern of presenting goals, theories, definitions, and assumptions. For readers that would like a more bottom up approach, they can start reading the [instance models](#Sec:IMs) and trace back to find any additional information they require.\n",

    "[Fig:sysCtxFig](#Figure:sysCtxFig) shows the system context. A circle represents an external entity outside the software, the user in this case. A rectangle represents the software system itself (ChemCode). Arrows are used to show the data flow between the system and its environment.\n",

Since Drasil is built on the idea of reusability, external libraries will be used to solve the integer programming problems. This was previously done with ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers, since \"creating a complete ODE solver in Drasil would take considerable time, and there are already many reliable external libraries ... tested by long use\" <a href=#chen2022>chen2022</a> (pg. 24). These rationales also apply to ILP solvers.\n",
